## Step 2: Chat Basics

## Step 4: Spawning a Thread

When you want the AI to make actual changes, it spawns a **worker thread**

The thread works on its own branch — your main content stays safe. All AI work will be reviewed by you before it merges.

**Try it now:**

Select the text below and ask the assistant: `Make this more concise and clear`

> In order to be able to successfully utilize the functionality of creating new pages, the user must first navigate to the left panel area and then proceed to right-click on the desired location where the new page should be created.

Watch the right panel. You'll see:

1. A new thread appears in the **Threads**
2. Status: **WORKING**
3. When done: **REVIEW**

---

## Step 5: Review Changes

Click on the thread (or switch to the **Threads**

The center panel shows a **diff view**

- Red = removed
- Green = added

You see exactly what the agent changed. Multiple users can review and discuss in the thread chat before deciding.

---

## Step 6: Accept or Reject

At the bottom of the review, you have two buttons:

- **Accept** — Merge the changes to main
- **Reject** — Discard the branch, keep original

**Try it:**

- If the fix looks good, click **Accept**
- The typo fix merges into this page
- Reload to see the result

1. **Edit pages** — real-time sync with other users
2. **Chat** with the assistant to find information
3. **Select text** to give context
